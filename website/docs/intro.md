## Quick Start

Get up and running with the OVH Snowflake provider in just a few steps:

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **Terraform** >= 1.0 installed
- **OVH Account** with API credentials
- **Snowflake Account** with appropriate permissions
- **Go** >= 1.21 (for development)

### Installation

1. **Add the provider to your Terraform configuration:**

```
terraform {
  required_providers {
    ovh-snowflake = {
      source  = "ovh/snowflake"
      version = "~> 0.1.0"
    }
  }
}
```

2. **Configure the provider:**

```
provider "ovh-snowflake" {
  # OVH Configuration
  ovh_endpoint          = "ovh-eu"
  ovh_application_key   = var.ovh_application_key
  ovh_application_secret = var.ovh_application_secret
  ovh_consumer_key      = var.ovh_consumer_key
  
  # Snowflake Configuration
  snowflake_account     = var.snowflake_account
  snowflake_user        = var.snowflake_user
  snowflake_private_key = var.snowflake_private_key
  snowflake_region      = var.snowflake_region
}
```

3. **Initialize Terraform:**

```bash
terraform init
```

### Your First Resource

Create a simple Snowflake database:

```
resource "ovh-snowflake_database" "example" {
  name    = "EXAMPLE_DB"
  comment = "Example database created with OVH Snowflake provider"
  
  tags = {
    environment = "development"
    team        = "data-engineering"
  }
}
```

Apply the configuration:

```bash
terraform plan
terraform apply
```
